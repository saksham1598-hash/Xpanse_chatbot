Official interpretation of Paragraph 37(a)(2)(iii). 
1. **Servicer's discretion.** Hazard insurance paid by a servicer at its discretion refers to circumstances in which a servicer pays a borrower's hazard insurance even though the servicer is not required by § 1024.17(k)(1), (2), or (5) to do so.
[See interpretation of Paragraph 37(a)(2)(iii). in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-a-2-iii-Interp)
**(b) Basis for charging borrower for force-placed insurance.** A servicer may not assess on a borrower a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance unless the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the mortgage loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance.
Official interpretation of 37(b) Basis for charging force-placed insurance. 
1. **Reasonable basis to believe.** Section § 1024.37(b) prohibits a servicer from assessing on a borrower a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance unless the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance. Information about a borrower's hazard insurance received by a servicer from the borrower, the borrower's insurance provider, or the borrower's insurance agent, may provide a servicer with a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has either complied with or failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance. If a servicer receives no such information, the servicer may satisfy the reasonable basis to believe standard if the servicer acts with reasonable diligence to ascertain a borrower's hazard insurance status and does not receive from the borrower, or otherwise have evidence of insurance coverage as provided in § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii). A servicer that complies with the notification requirements set forth in § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) and (ii) has acted with reasonable diligence.

**(c) Requirements before charging borrower for force-placed insurance** —

[See interpretation of 37(c) Requirements before charging borrower for force-placed insurance. in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-c-Interp)
**(1) In general.** Before a servicer assesses on a borrower any premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance, the servicer must:
Official interpretation of 37(c)(1) In general. 
[See interpretation of 37(c)(1) In general. in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-c-1-Interp)
**(i)** Deliver to a borrower or place in the mail a written notice containing the information required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section at least 45 days before a servicer assesses on a borrower such charge or fee;
Official interpretation of Paragraph 37(c)(1)(i). 
1. **Assessing premium charge or fee.** Subject to the requirements of § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) through (iii), if not prohibited by State or other applicable law, a servicer may charge a borrower for force-placed insurance the servicer purchased, retroactive to the first day of any period of time in which the borrower did not have hazard insurance in place.
[See interpretation of Paragraph 37(c)(1)(i). in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-c-1-i-Interp)
**(ii)** Deliver to the borrower or place in the mail a written notice in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section; and
**(iii)** By the end of the 15-day period beginning on the date the written notice described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section was delivered to the borrower or placed in the mail, not have received, from the borrower or otherwise, evidence demonstrating that the borrower has had in place, continuously, hazard insurance coverage that complies with the loan contract's requirements to maintain hazard insurance.
Official interpretation of Paragraph 37(c)(1)(iii). 
1. **Extension of time.** Applicable law, such as State law or the terms and conditions of a borrower's insurance policy, may provide for an extension of time to pay the premium on a borrower's hazard insurance after the due date. If a premium payment is made within such time, and the insurance company accepts the payment with no lapse in insurance coverage, then the borrower's hazard insurance is deemed to have had hazard insurance coverage continuously for purposes of § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii).
2. **Evidence demonstrating insurance.** As evidence of continuous hazard insurance coverage that complies with the loan contract's requirements, a servicer may require a copy of the borrower's hazard insurance policy declaration page, the borrower's insurance certificate, the borrower's insurance policy, or other similar forms of written confirmation. A servicer may reject evidence of hazard insurance coverage submitted by the borrower if neither the borrower's insurance provider nor insurance agent provides confirmation of the insurance information submitted by the borrower, or if the terms and conditions of the borrower's hazard insurance policy do not comply with the borrower's loan contract requirements.
[See interpretation of Paragraph 37(c)(1)(iii). in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-c-1-iii-Interp)

Official interpretation of Paragraph 37(c)(2)(v). 
1. **Identifying type of hazard insurance.** If the terms of a mortgage loan contract requires a borrower to purchase both a homeowners' insurance policy and a separate hazard insurance policy to insure against loss resulting from hazards not covered under the borrower's homeowners' insurance policy, a servicer must disclose whether it is the borrower's homeowners' insurance policy or the separate hazard insurance policy for which it lacks evidence of coverage to comply with § 1024.37(c)(2)(v).
[See interpretation of Paragraph 37(c)(2)(v). in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-c-2-v-Interp)
**(A)** The borrower's hazard insurance is expiring, has expired, or provides insufficient coverage, as applicable;
**(B)** The servicer does not have evidence that the borrower has hazard insurance coverage past the expiration date or evidence that the borrower has hazard insurance that provides sufficient coverage, as applicable; and
**(C)** If applicable, identifies the type of hazard insurance for which the servicer lacks evidence of coverage;
**(vi)** A statement that hazard insurance is required on the borrower's property, and that the servicer has purchased or will purchase, as applicable, such insurance at the borrower's expense;

**(xi)** If applicable, a statement advising the borrower to review additional information provided in the same transmittal.
**(3) Format.** A servicer must set the information required by paragraphs (c)(2)(iv), (vi), and (ix)(A) and (B) in bold text, except that the information about the physical address of the borrower's property required by paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section may be set in regular text. A servicer may use form MS-3A in appendix MS-3 of this part to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (2) of this section.
**(4) Additional information.** Except for the mortgage loan account number, a servicer may not include any information other than information required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section in the written notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. However, a servicer may provide such additional information to a borrower on separate pieces of paper in the same transmittal.
**(d) Reminder notice** —
Official interpretation of 37(d) Reminder notice. 
[See interpretation of 37(d) Reminder notice. in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-d-Interp)
**(1) In general.** The notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section shall be delivered to the borrower or placed in the mail at least 15 days before a servicer assesses on a borrower a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance. A servicer may not deliver to a borrower or place in the mail the notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section until at least 30 days after delivering to the borrower or placing in the mail the written notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
Official interpretation of 37(d)(1) In general. 
1. When a servicer is required to deliver or place in the mail the written notice pursuant to § 1024.37(d)(1), the content of the reminder notice will be different depending on the insurance information the servicer has received from the borrower. For example:
i. Assume that, on June 1, the servicer places in the mail the written notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) to Borrower A. The servicer does not receive any insurance information from Borrower A. The servicer must deliver to Borrower A or place in the mail a reminder notice, with the information required by § 1024.37(d)(2)(i), at least 30 days after June 1 and at least 15 days before the servicer charges Borrower A for force-placed insurance.
ii. Assume the same example, except that Borrower A provides the servicer with insurance information on June 18, but the servicer cannot verify that Borrower A has hazard insurance in place continuously based on the information Borrower A provided (**e.g.,** the servicer cannot verify that Borrower A had coverage between June 10 and June 15). The servicer must either deliver to Borrower A or place in the mail a reminder notice, with the information required by in § 1024.37(d)(2)(ii), at least 30 days after June 1 and at least 15 days before charging Borrower A for force-placed insurance it obtains for the period between June 10 and June 15.

**(2) Content of the reminder notice** —
Official interpretation of 37(d)(2) Content of reminder notice. 
[See interpretation of 37(d)(2) Content of reminder notice. in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-d-2-Interp)
**(i) Servicer receiving no insurance information.** A servicer that receives no hazard insurance information after delivering to the borrower or placing in the mail the notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must set forth in the notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section:
Official interpretation of 37(d)(2)(i) Servicer receiving no insurance information. 
[See interpretation of 37(d)(2)(i) Servicer receiving no insurance information. in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-d-2-i-Interp)
**(A)** The date of the notice;
**(B)** A statement that the notice is the second and final notice;
**(C)** The information required by paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (xi) of this section; and
**(D)** The cost of the force-placed insurance, stated as an annual premium, except if a servicer does not know the cost of force-placed insurance, a reasonable estimate shall be disclosed and identified as such.
Official interpretation of Paragraph 37(d)(2)(i)(D). 
1. **Reasonable estimate of the cost of force-placed insurance.** Differences between the amount of the estimated cost disclosed under § 1024.37(d)(2)(i)(D) and the actual cost later assessed to the borrower are permissible, so long as the estimated cost is based on the information reasonably available to the servicer at the time the disclosure is provided. For example, a mortgage investor's requirements may provide that the amount of coverage for force-placed insurance depends on the borrower's delinquency status (the number of days the borrower's mortgage payment is past due). The amount of coverage affects the cost of force-placed insurance. A servicer that provides an estimate of the cost of force-placed insurance based on the borrower's delinquency status at the time the disclosure is made complies with § 1024.37(d)(2)(i)(D).
[See interpretation of Paragraph 37(d)(2)(i)(D). in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-d-2-i-D-Interp)
**(ii) Servicer lacking evidence of continuous coverage.** A servicer that has received hazard insurance information after delivering to a borrower or placing in the mail the notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, but has not received, from the borrower or otherwise, evidence demonstrating that the borrower has had sufficient hazard insurance coverage in place continuously, must set forth in the notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section the following information:
**(A)** The date of the notice;
**(B)** The information required by paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (iv) and (ix) through (xi) and (d)(2)(i)(B) and (D) of this section;
**(C)** A statement that the servicer has received the hazard insurance information that the borrower provided;
**(D)** A statement that requests the borrower to provide the information that is missing;
**(E)** A statement that the borrower will be charged for insurance the servicer has purchased or purchases for the period of time during which the servicer is unable to verify coverage;
**(3) Format.** A servicer must set the information required by paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (D) of this section in bold text. The requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section apply to the information required by paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section. A servicer may use form MS-3B in appendix MS-3 of this part to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(i) of this section. A servicer may use form MS-3C in appendix MS-3 of this part to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
**(4) Additional information.** Except for the borrower's mortgage loan account number, a servicer may not include any information other than information required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, in the written notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. However, a servicer may provide such additional information to a borrower on separate pieces of paper in the same transmittal.
**(5) Updating notice with borrower information.** If a servicer receives new information about a borrower's hazard insurance after a written notice required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section has been put into production, the servicer is not required to update such notice based on the new information so long as the notice was put into production a reasonable time prior to the servicer delivering the notice to the borrower or placing the notice in the mail.
Official interpretation of 37(d)(5) Updating notice with borrower information. 
1. **Reasonable time.** If the written notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(ii) was put into production a reasonable time prior to the servicer delivering or placing the notice in the mail, the servicer is not required to update the notice with new insurance information received. For purposes of § 1024.37(d)(5), a reasonable time is no more than five days (excluding legal holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays).
[See interpretation of 37(d)(5) Updating notice with borrower information. in Supplement I](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/interp-37/#37-d-5-Interp)

**(iii) Charging a borrower before end of notice period.** Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, if not prohibited by State or other applicable law, if a servicer has renewed or replaced existing force-placed insurance and receives evidence demonstrating that the borrower lacked insurance coverage for some period of time following the expiration of the existing force-placed insurance (including during the notice period prescribed by paragraph (e)(1) of this section), the servicer may, promptly upon receiving such evidence, assess on the borrower a premium charge or fee related to renewing or replacing existing force-placed insurance for that period of time.

To illustrate, assume that on January 2, the servicer sends the notice required by § 1024.37(e)(1)(i). At 12:01 a.m. on January 12, the existing force-placed insurance the servicer had purchased on the borrower's property expires and the servicer replaces the expired force-placed insurance policy with a new policy. On February 5, the servicer receives evidence demonstrating the borrower has hazard insurance effective since 12:01 a.m. on January 31.

**(vi)** A statement that:
**(A)** The insurance the servicer purchased previously has expired or is expiring, as applicable; and
